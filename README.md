# PacmanGame

##Authors Shalhevet Gamliel and Naomi

This is a pacman game where we get to play with a single pacman that can:
Eat fruits
Be eaten by ghosts
Have other pacmans eat its fruits
Also we have to avoid touching boxes because we will lose points.
The game is played during a given amount of time.

##Figures of the game:

Pacman: Try to eat as many fruits as possible
Ghosts: Try to eat the main player.
BOXES: Every time the main player touches a box he loses points
Fruit: Points for the pacman/player
Me: The main player. Eats as much as he cans during the given time to get points and avoid ghosts and boxes. He can eat pacman too.

## Manual game 

We open a csv and choose a file with data for the figures of the game.
We place our player where ever we want amd start the game.
As soon as the glame is launched, the pacman and ghosts start moving and so do we.
To change the direction of our player we clicked on a point we want to reach and automatically the player changes direction.
